How to install Conda on Le Potato Ubuntu Versions?

---
# Failed Test

## When I try to run the installer:

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh
I get this error:

Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh: line 358: 25417 Illegal instruction (core dumped) “$CONDA_EXEC” constructor --prefix “$PREFIX” --extract-conda-pkgs

It works on other VPS like Amazon ec2s , how can I get a conda environment installed on my Le Potato?

PS. I also tried installing Anaconda as an alternative, but this process got hung up on the command line.
